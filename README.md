# Overview
This repository contains instructions for deploying a SensiML [SensiML Analytics
Studio](https://sensiml.com/products/analytics-studio/) project to any xc8,
xc16, or xc32 supported platform. Users of the SAMD21 ML Eval Kit (i.e.
[EV45Y33A](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/EV45Y33A)
or
[EV18H79A](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/EV18H79A))
should visit the [SAMD21 SensiML
Template](https://github.com/MicrochipTech/ml-samd21-iot-sensiml-template)
repository which contains a complete firmware implementation.

## Software Used
* MPLABÂ® X IDE (https://microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)

# Knowledge Pack Deployment
To deploy a knowledge pack from the SensiML Analytics Studio:

1. Open up your SensiML project in the [Analytics Studio](https://app.sensiml.cloud/) and navigate to the *Download Model* tab.

2. Select `Microchip SAMD21 ML Eval Kit` from the *HW Platform* options.

   - *Although SAMD21 ML Eval Kit is specified as the hardware platform, the
   *Source* format option will generate code that should be compatible with any
   xc compiler platform.*

3. Select one of *Binary*, *Library*, or *Source* from the *Format* options.

   - Note that the *Source format is only available for upper tier SensiML
     customers*.

4. Select the appropriate sensor configuration for your project from the *Data
   Source* options.

   - *Note that this configuration should match the one you used to capture the
   data your model was trained with.*

   - *This step is only relevant for the SAMD21 ML Eval Kit - in all other cases
   you will have to manually verify your sensor configuration*

5. Click the *Download* button to download the model.

# Knowledge Pack Library Compilation
The following steps cover the process of manually compiling the SensiML source
code into a static library object. This step is not required for integration,
but is typically less problematic than integrating source code directly.

## Using `build.sh`

1. (*For Windows users only*) Install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

2. Install MPLAB X version 6.00 or greater.

3. Install a DFP for the target device family (e.g. AVR-Dx). DFPs can be
   installed from MPLAB X or manually from
   https://packs.download.microchip.com/.

4. Extract the library archive from the step above directly into this folder.
   The zip file should contain a folder named `knowledgepack` where the SensiML
   source code is located.

5. (Optional) Open `options.ini` and modify as needed.

6. Set the environment variables `MPLABX_VERSION XC_NUMBER_BITS XC_VERSION` as
   desired, then run `build.sh` to generate the library object. For example:

   `MPLABX_VERSION=6.00 XC_VERSION=4.00 XC_NUMBER_BITS=32 ./build.sh ATSAME54P20A libsensiml .`

   > *By default `build.sh` will select the latest program versions found on
   > your system in the default install locations. If MPLAB X or the XC compiler
   > are in non-default install locations, manually set the corresponding path
   > directly through the `MPLABX_PATH` and/or `XC_PATH` environment variables.*

7. See the [integration instructions](#knowledge-pack-integration) below to
   integrate the library with your MPLAB X project.

## Using Docker
For convenience, `docker_build.sh` is provided which contains a full example for
building the docker image and generating the SensiML library/project. This
script can be run by passing the target name and the corresponding .args file e.g.:

```bash
./docker_build.sh ATSAME54P20A args/SAME54.args
```

The output of the build process will be placed in a folder named `dist/` under
your current working directory.

Note: The `.args` files included in this repository may not always be up to
date. Check
[packs.download.microchip.com](https://packs.download.microchip.com/) for the
most up to date device family pack listings.

## Usage Notes
- `*.options.ini` can be modified to set additional project options; for help
  call the MPLAB script `prjMakefilesGenerator -setoptions=@ -help`
  + NB: all relative paths are considered relative to the project root folder
    (.X folder)
- `*.project.ini` is just a placeholder - the **languageToolchain** and
  **device** variables are replaced when building the project - others will take
  default values if unspecified.

# Knowledge Pack Integration

## Binary Format
*At the time of this writing this option is only supported for the SAMD21 ML Eval Kit*

If you deployed a knowledge pack in the *Binary* format, the archive should
contain the binary file which can be written directly to the evaluation board.

## Library Format
Below are instructions for a SensiML library object into an MPLAB X project. For
guidance on compiling source code into a library object refer to [Knowledge Pack
Library Compilation](#knowledge-pack-library-compilation).

1. Add the library object from the step above into an existing MPLAB project as
   shown below.

   ![Add library object](assets/addlibrary.png)

2. Extract the SensiML deployment archive somewhere into your project
   directory.

3. Add the path to the `inc` folder from the SensiML deployment archive (e.g.
   `../knowledgepack/sensiml/inc`) into your XC compiler include path in the
   *Project Properties*.

## Source Format
Follow the steps below to directly integrate the SensiML source code into your
MPLAB X project. Alternatively, you may use the included build scripts to [build
the source code into a library object](#knowledge-pack-library-compilation)
before integration.

1. In MPLAB X, open up the .X project folder under the `firmware` folder of this repository.

2. In the *Projects* pane, right click the *Header Files* folder and select *Add
   Existing Items from Folders* from the options.

3. In the resulting window that opens, click the *Add Folder* button.

4. In the new dialog, select *Header Files* from the *Files of Type* dropdown,
   then navigate to the project's `firmware` directory and select the
   `knowledgepack` directory. Click the *Select* button to add the directory.

   | Recursively add header files (.h) under the `knowledgepack` folder |

5. Back in the *Add Files* window, click the *Add* button to finish adding the
   necessary header files and close the dialog.

6. Right click the *Source Files* folder in the *Projects* pane and select *Add
   Existing Items from Folders* from the menu. Repeat steps 4-6 to add all
   source files (.c files) from the `knowledgepack` folder.

7. Add the path to the `inc` folder from the SensiML deployment archive (e.g.
   `../knowledgepack/sensiml/inc`) into your XC compiler include path in the
   *Project Properties*.

# Knowledge Pack API
Once the library has been integrated, you just need to add a few hooks into your
project to perform inferencing with the SensiML model's API; the `src/main.c`
file provides a skeleton implementation which you can use as a template for your
own project.

For more detailed information on the SensiML API visit the [SensiML
Documentation](https://sensiml.com/documentation/knowledge-packs/building-a-knowledge-pack-library.html#calling-knowledge-pack-apis-from-your-code).
