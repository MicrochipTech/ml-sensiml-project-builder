# Overview
This repository contains instructions for creating a library object from a
[SensiML Analytics Studio](https://sensiml.com/products/analytics-studio/)
project deployment for any xc8, xc16, or xc32 supported platform.

## Usage Notes

- If you plan on running `build.sh` from a Windows machine you will require [Git
  Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).
- `*.options.ini` can be modified to set additional project options; for help
  call the MPLAB script `prjMakefilesGenerator -setoptions=@ -help`
  + NB: all relative paths are considered relative to the project root folder
    (.X folder)
- `*.project.ini` is just a placeholder - the **languageToolchain** and
  **device** variables are replaced when building the project - others will take
  default values if unspecified.

## Software Used
* MPLABÂ® X IDE *>=6.00* (https://microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)

# Knowledge Pack Deployment
To deploy a knowledge pack from the SensiML Analytics Studio:

1. Open up your SensiML project in the [Analytics Studio](https://app.sensiml.cloud/) and navigate to the *Download Model* tab.
2. Select `Microchip SAMD21 ML Eval Kit` from the *HW Platform* options.
   - *Although SAMD21 ML Eval Kit is specified as the hardware platform, the
   resulting source code should be compatible with any Microchip platform.*
3. Select one of *Binary*, *Library* or *Source* from the *Format* options.
   - *Source format is only available for upper tier SensiML customers*.
4. Select the appropriate sensor configuration for your project from the *Data
   Source* options.

   - *Note that this configuration should match the one you used to capture the
   data your model was trained with.*

   - *This step is only relevant for the SAMD21 ML Eval Kit - in all other cases
   you will have to manually verify your sensor configuration*
5. Click the *Download* button to download the model.

# Knowledge Pack Compilation

The following steps cover compiling the SensiML source code into a static
library object.

## Using `build.sh`

1. Extract the library archive from the step above directly into this folder.
   The zip file should contain a folder named `knowledgepack` where all the
   SensiML source code is located.

2. (Optional) Open `options.ini` and modify as needed.

3. Set the environment variables `MPLABX_VERSION XC_NUMBER_BITS XC_VERSION` as
   desired, then run `build.sh` to generate the library object. For example:

   `MPLABX_VERSION=6.00 XC_VERSION=4.00 XC_NUMBER_BITS=32 ./build.sh ATSAME54P20A libsensiml .`

   If MPLAB and/or XC versions are unspecified, the program will select the
   latest versions found on your system in the default install locations. If
   MPLAB X or the XC compiler are in non-default install locations, you can
   manually set the corresponding path directly through the `MPLABX_PATH` and
   `XC_PATH` environment variables.

4. See the [integration instructions](#integration-instructions) below to
   integrate the library with your MPLAB X project.

## Using Docker

For convenience, `docker_build.sh` is provided which contains a full example for
building the docker image and generating the SensiML library/project. This
script can be run by passing the target name and the corresponding .args file e.g.:

```bash
./docker_build.sh ATSAME54P20A args/SAME54.args
```

The output of the build process will be placed in a folder named `dist/` under
your current working directory.

Note: The `.args` files included in this repository may not always be up to
date. Check

most up to date device family pack listings.

# Knowledge Pack Integration
Below are instructions for integrating the library object, compiled with the
steps above, into an MPLAB X project.

1. Add the library object from the step above into an existing MPLAB project as
   shown below.

2. Extract the SensiML deployment archive somewhere into your project
   directory.

3. Add the path to the `inc` folder from the SensiML deployment archive (e.g.
   `../knowledgepack/sensiml/inc`) into your include path under *Project
   Properties* -> *xc32/16/8-gcc* -> *Preprocessing and messages* -> *Common
   include dirs*

4. Ensure that the `Remove unused sections` option under *Project Properties* ->
   *xc32-ld* is enabled (option is shown in the image below); this will
   eliminate any unused data or functions from the SDK to reclaim device memory.

5. Use `src/main.c` as a template for integrating the SensiML library
   into your project.

You should now have your SensiML model fully integrated with an MPLAB X project.
In order to update the deployed model, simply repeat the steps from the [build
instructions](#sensiml-sdk-build-instructions) section above.
